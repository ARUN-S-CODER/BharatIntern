# BharatIntern
During my web development internship at BharatIntern, I successfully completed two significant tasks. Firstly, I designed and developed a personal Portfolio Website to showcase my skills and projects. Secondly, I created a Duplicate Version of Netflix Website, demonstrating my proficiency in frontend technologies. The experience enhanced my web development skills, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and contributing to my growth as a developer
